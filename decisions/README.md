# Decisions

This folder holds the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Each ADR captures one decision, its context, the alternatives considered, and its consequences. Together, they form the project's decision history.

---

## Format

Each ADR is one markdown file with the following structure:

```
# NNNN — Title

**Status**: Accepted | Proposed | Superseded by NNNN
**Type**: Durable | Ephemeral
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What problem or question prompted this decision.

## Decision
What was decided.

## Alternatives considered
What else was on the table, and why not.

## Consequences
What becomes easier, harder, or constrained as a result.
```

### Filenames

`NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`, where NNNN is a zero-padded sequential number (0001, 0002, ...). Numbers are never reused, even when decisions are superseded.

### Status

- **Proposed** — drafted, not yet approved by the human.
- **Accepted** — current, active decision.
- **Superseded by NNNN** — replaced by a later ADR. The superseded ADR is kept for history; the new one references it.

### Type

- **Durable** — effectively permanent. Revising requires a new superseding ADR with explicit reasoning. Small adjustments that do not reverse the decision (timing slips, parking a sub-item) may instead be recorded as a dated amendment note appended to the ADR and reflected in the index Status column *(maintainer, 2026-08-06)*; supersession remains required for genuine reversals.
- **Ephemeral** — expected to change as the project evolves. Can be updated in place with a dated note appended to the ADR; supersession is not required.

## Adding a new ADR

1. Claim the next available number by checking the highest NNNN in use.
2. Create `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` using the format above.
3. Draft the ADR. Claude Code may draft; the human finalises.
4. Add a row to the index in this README.
5. Commit with a message like `docs: add ADR-NNNN on <title>`.
