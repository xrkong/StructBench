"""Dynamic k-capped radius graph for the hybrid MP-Transolver branch (Design A).

The local message-passing branch of the hybrid Transolver (a middle-block
residual, see :class:`~structbench.models.transolver.network.LocalMessagePassing`)
runs over a *dynamic* radius graph rebuilt each step from the current
positions. This module builds that graph.

Why a bespoke builder rather than reusing MGN's ``world_edges`` or GeoFLARE's
``ball_query`` verbatim (the G3-P3 critique, §4b):

* :func:`structbench.models.mgn.mesh_ops.world_edges` returns an **uncapped**
  ``(2, E)`` index — every pair within ``radius``. Under contact/compaction
  ``E`` grows super-linearly and blew up MGN's world-edge activations at
  ~760 k steps (the ``mgn-worldedge-oom-fix`` episode). The hybrid branch
  needs a **bounded** ``E``.
* :func:`structbench.models.geoflare.geo_ops.ball_query` *is* k-capped, but it
  returns padded neighbour **coordinates** ``(P, k, dim)``, not an
  ``edge_index`` — its neighbour indices are internal and never surfaced.

So this module writes the missing piece: a **k-capped radius edge-index**
(top-``max_neighbors`` nearest within ``radius`` per node, so ``E <= P *
max_neighbors``) plus MGN-style relative-position edge features
``[x_ij, |x_ij|]``. Edge direction follows the project convention
(``edge_index[0]`` sender, ``edge_index[1]`` receiver; a message on edge
``(j, i)`` is aggregated into receiver ``i``): each node ``i`` receives from
its nearest neighbours ``j``. Graphs are built **per example** (partitioned by
``n_particles_per_example``) so no edge crosses an example boundary — the
same invariant that keeps MGN's ``index_add_`` aggregation segment-safe.

Graph construction lives with the model that uses it (ADR-0020 precedent,
``models/mgn/mesh_ops.py``, ``models/geoflare/geo_ops.py``).

    Parameters
    ----------
