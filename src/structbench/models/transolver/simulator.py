"""``TransolverSimulator``: Transolver's stateful rollout wrapper (ADR-0041/0043/0044).

The full per-case-binding statefulness contract (bind per case, reset before
each eval pass, step pointer, tripwire semantics) is inherited from
:class:`~structbench.models.common.simulator_base.CaseBoundSimulator` and
documented in that module's docstring — it is not repeated here. This module
covers what is Transolver-specific: network sizing and the point-set feature
builder.

**Edge-free sibling of MGN.** Unlike
:class:`~structbench.models.mgn.simulator.MeshSimulator`, there are no
graphs and no edges here: node features are
``cat([one_hot, scripted_velocity, x_t, reference_coords], -1)`` =
``node_type_size + 3 * dim`` channels (18 for the ADR-0043 recipe's
``node_type_size=9``, ``dim=3``), and :class:`~.network.TransolverNet` is
called with ``n_particles_per_example`` (batched training) or ``None``
(single bound-case eval, the inference fast path). A velocity-history run
(ADR-0049, ``history_velocities > 0``) appends the window's flattened
finite-difference velocities, adding ``history_velocities * dim`` channels.

    """Transolver (Physics-Attention) simulator with per-case GT binding.

    See :class:`~structbench.models.common.simulator_base.CaseBoundSimulator`'s
    module docstring for the full statefulness contract (bind per case,
    reset before each eval pass, tripwire semantics) — it is not repeated
    here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dim:
        Spatial dimensionality of node positions.
    hidden_dim:
        Channel width, forwarded to :class:`~.network.TransolverNet`.
    n_layers:
        Number of Transolver blocks, forwarded to
        :class:`~.network.TransolverNet`.
    n_heads:
        Number of Physics-Attention heads per block, forwarded to
        :class:`~.network.TransolverNet`.
    slice_num:
        Number of Physics-Attention slice tokens, forwarded to
        :class:`~.network.TransolverNet`.
    mlp_ratio:
        FFN hidden-width multiplier inside each block, forwarded to
        :class:`~.network.TransolverNet`.
    dropout:
        Dropout probability, forwarded to :class:`~.network.TransolverNet`.
    node_type_size:
        Width of the one-hot node-type encoding (``NodeType.SIZE`` in the
        source MeshGraphNets framework).
    kinematic_types:
        Node-type codes whose motion is prescribed by ground truth; their
        rows anchor and verify the step pointer (the tripwire).
    scripted_types:
        Node-type codes whose next-step ground-truth velocity is fed as a
        node input feature (a subset of ``kinematic_types`` in the ADR-0043
        recipe: OBSTACLE is scripted, HANDLE is not).
    history_velocities:
        Number of finite-difference window velocities appended to the node
        features (ADR-0049); ``0`` keeps the reference Markovian-in-position
        feature builder.
    frames_per_call:
        Frames the decoder emits per forward call (ADR-0050/0051 ``k``),
        already resolved to a concrete count (the k=T sentinel ``0`` is
        resolved by :func:`~structbench.cli.train.build_transolver_simulator`
        before construction). ``1`` (default) is the byte-identical
        autoregressive scheme; ``k>1`` widens the decoder head to
        ``k*(dim+1)`` and makes :meth:`predict_positions` / :meth:`forward_train`
        emit ``k`` per-frame velocities (integrated on eval). The 1<k<T
        training-seam pushforward lives in the training loop, not here.
    device:
        Device the network and normalizer buffers are moved to at
        construction time.

            compatibility with :mod:`structbench.eval`.

            frame, so the pointer must advance by 1. A no-op at ``k=1`` (the

        Parameters
        ----------
        x_last:
            ``(P, dim)`` current world positions; noise (if any) has ALREADY
            been applied by the caller before this method is called.
        next_positions:
            Ground-truth next-frame world positions: ``(P, dim)`` at ``k=1``;
            ``(P, k, dim)`` at ``k>1`` (the k bundled target frames).
        next_aux:
            Ground-truth stress (working-frame units, e.g. MPa): ``(P,)`` at
            ``k=1``; ``(P, k)`` at ``k>1``.
        particle_types:
            ``(P,)`` int64 node-type codes.
        reference_coords:
            ``(P, dim)`` mesh-space (rest/reference) coordinates, as
            produced by
            :func:`~structbench.models.mgn.collate.collate_mesh_samples`.
        n_particles_per_example:
            ``(B,)`` int64 per-example node counts from the collate step;
            forwarded to :class:`~.network.TransolverNet` to drive its
            per-example segment loop (ragged-batch Physics-Attention).
        accumulate:
            If ``True``, this call's features are folded into both
            ``OnlineNormalizer`` running statistics (node and target).
        velocity_history:

            computed by the caller from the NOISY position window
            (ADR-0049); required exactly when the simulator was built with
            ``history_velocities > 0``.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple[Tensor, Tensor]
            ``(pred_norm, target_norm)``: the raw network output (already in
            normalized/target space, matching what :meth:`predict_positions`
            inverse-normalizes) and the normalized ground-truth target. Each is
            ``(P, dim + 1)`` at ``k=1`` (target
            ``cat([next_positions - x_last, next_aux[:, None]], dim=1)``) and

            velocity targets ``cat([Δpositions, next_aux[..., None]], -1)``,
            normalized on the row-folded ``(P*k, dim+1)`` view).

        Notes
        -----
        The one-hot node-type encoding is built here; the scripted-velocity
        node input is delegated to the inherited
        :meth:`~structbench.models.common.simulator_base.CaseBoundSimulator._train_scripted_velocity`
        (``next_positions - x_last`` on scripted rows, zero elsewhere) since
        its source differs from the eval path's bound ground truth; the rest
        of the feature assembly is shared with :meth:`predict_positions` via
        :meth:`_features`.

        gamma = 1.0 falls out of the construction here: the caller is
        expected to have already added noise to ``x_last``, so the velocity
        target ``next_positions - x_last`` is measured from the noisy
        position, matching the source MeshGraphNets training recipe without
        a separate noise-correction term. On the velocity-history path
        (ADR-0049) the caller instead passes the noise-ADJUSTED next
        position (``next + noise[:, -1]``, the GNS reference convention),
        so the same subtraction yields the CLEAN next velocity — velocity
        noise is corrected exactly, the accumulated random-walk position
        offset deliberately is not (see ``_mesh_family_noise``).
