"""``CaseBoundSimulator``: shared per-case-binding state base (ADR-0043 §8).

Extracted (move-only) from MGN's ``MeshSimulator``
(:mod:`structbench.models.mgn.simulator`) as the state and control-flow every
case-bound simulator family shares — MGN today, the Transolver family next
(ADR-0041's multi-method plan). A subclass supplies its own network and
feature-building (graph-specific for MGN, point-set-specific for Transolver);
this base never touches either.

**STATEFULNESS CONTRACT — READ BEFORE USE.**

A ``CaseBoundSimulator`` subclass carries two kinds of state that must not be
confused:

1. Model parameters and any per-family normalizer buffers (e.g. MGN's four
   :class:`~structbench.models.mgn.normalizers.OnlineNormalizer` buffers).
   These live in ``state_dict()`` and travel with a checkpoint via
   :meth:`CaseBoundSimulator.save`/:meth:`CaseBoundSimulator.load`. They are
   **case-independent**.
2. Per-case binding, set by :meth:`CaseBoundSimulator.bind_case` and held as
   PLAIN (non-buffer, non-parameter) attributes, so a checkpoint never
   carries case data. Binding a case caches: the mesh-space reference
   coordinates, the one-hot node types, the kinematic-particle mask, and the
   bound case's FULL ground-truth position trajectory ``(T, P, dim)`` — of
   which only the KINEMATIC rows are ever read (the scripted-actuator
   velocity input, and the tripwire below). A subclass may cache additional
   per-case geometry (e.g. MGN's mesh edge index) via the
   :meth:`CaseBoundSimulator._on_bind_case` hook. Binding also resets the
   autoregressive step pointer.

A subclass's ``predict_positions`` (MGN's is the reference implementation) is
the ONLY method ``structbench.eval`` calls
(:func:`~structbench.eval.rollout.rollout`,
:func:`~structbench.eval.rollout.one_step_position_rmse`,
:func:`~structbench.eval.rollout.one_step_aux_rmse`) — none of them pass any
per-case context. Consequently:

* Call :meth:`CaseBoundSimulator.bind_case` before the first
  ``predict_positions`` call of an eval pass on a given trajectory.
* Call :meth:`CaseBoundSimulator.reset_rollout` before **EACH** separate eval
  pass over the SAME bound case. A fresh rollout and a fresh one-step sweep
  are two separate eval passes, and each needs its own ``reset_rollout()`` —
  the step pointer has no way to know an eval pass has ended on its own.

**Step pointer — deterministic, never search-based.** The first
``predict_positions`` call after ``bind_case``/``reset_rollout`` anchors the
pointer at ``t = F`` (``F`` = the input window's frame count), because every
eval entry point — rollout's autoregressive loop and both one-step
teacher-forced sweeps — makes its first call with a window whose last frame
is ground-truth frame ``F - 1``. Every subsequent call advances the pointer
by 1. :meth:`CaseBoundSimulator._advance_pointer` implements this.

**Tripwire — verification only, never anchoring.** At every call (when
kinematic particles are bound), the input window's kinematic rows are
compared against the bound ground truth at frame ``t - 1`` (``atol=1e-4``).
A mismatch raises ``RuntimeError`` naming both likely causes: a stale
rollout pointer (call ``reset_rollout()`` before each eval pass) or a
case/trajectory mismatch (``bind_case`` was not (re)bound to the trajectory
under evaluation). This check stays exact even when a kinematic particle is
stationary across consecutive frames (e.g. a HANDLE node paused
mid-actuation) — the exact failure mode a search-based "find this window in
the GT" anchor would silently mishandle. With no kinematic particles bound,
the pointer/tripwire logic is skipped entirely and the scripted-velocity
input is always zero.

**Scripted-velocity feature.** :meth:`CaseBoundSimulator._eval_scripted_velocity`
(eval path) and :meth:`CaseBoundSimulator._train_scripted_velocity` (training
path) both compute the scripted-actuator velocity node feature —
GT-next-frame minus current position on ``scripted_types`` rows, zero
elsewhere — from different sources (the bound ground truth vs. the caller's
``next_positions``) but the same semantics; see each method's docstring.

    """Per-case GT-binding state base shared by case-bound simulators.

    See the module docstring for the full statefulness contract (bind per
    case, reset before each eval pass, tripwire semantics) — it is not
    repeated here. A subclass builds its own network and normalizers, and
    overrides :meth:`_on_bind_case` for any per-case geometry it needs
    beyond what is cached here (e.g. MGN's mesh edge index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    dim:
        Spatial dimensionality of node positions.
    node_type_size:
        Width of the one-hot node-type encoding (``NodeType.SIZE`` in the
        source MeshGraphNets framework).
    kinematic_types:
        Node-type codes whose motion is prescribed by ground truth; their
        rows anchor and verify the step pointer (the tripwire).
    scripted_types:
        Node-type codes whose next-step ground-truth velocity is fed as a
        node input feature (a subset of ``kinematic_types`` in the ADR-0043
        recipe: OBSTACLE is scripted, HANDLE is not).
    history_velocities:
        Number of finite-difference window velocities appended to the node
        features (ADR-0049). ``0`` (the reference recipe) keeps the feature
        builder Markovian in position; a velocity-history run sets it to
        ``input_frames - 1``, and :meth:`_window_velocity_history` builds
        the feature from the rollout window.
    device:
        Device the module is moved to at construction time. A subclass that
        registers parameters/buffers after calling ``super().__init__()``
        must call ``self.to(device)`` again once those exist.
