"""Grouped run configuration: typed sections, strict loading (ADR-0032, ADR-0035).

A run config is a TOML file with sections mirroring ownership::

    [run]       benchmark, seed                     (orchestration)
    [model]     family + every field of the family  (architecture)
    [train]     every schedule field                (optimization)

Loading is strict: unknown sections or keys are errors, and ``[model]`` /
``[train]`` must be complete — a missing key is an error, never a silent
fallback to a dataclass default. The dataclass defaults below exist only for
programmatic construction (tests, notebooks); TOML-driven runs state every
value explicitly. The one exception is ``[train].lr_decay_steps``, which is
*derived* from ``training_steps`` to hold the reference LR-anneal depth and
must not be set in the file (see :func:`_derive_lr_decay_steps`).

Benchmark *protocol* (``input_frames``, horizon, eval times) is not free run
configuration: it lives on the benchmark card, pinned per benchmark ADR. Under
ADR-0035 the model's ``input_frames`` (history length) *is* the rollout seed
count, so a config whose ``[model].input_frames`` disagrees with the benchmark
card is rejected at load — the model observes exactly the frames it inputs, and
the constant-velocity backfill of ADR-0032 §4 is gone.

        exactly ``input_frames`` ground-truth frames and scores
        ``[input_frames, end]`` — there is no backfill, so it must equal the

    nmlp_layers : int

        (``asinh(aux / aux_transform_scale)``). A heavy-tailed auxiliary field
        (notch-impact max principal strain: bulk ~1e-3, tail ~1) z-scores its
        decision region into the distribution bulk where MSE under-resolves
        it; the transform spreads that region before normalization. Stats,
        the training target, and the decoder all live in transformed space;
        predictions are inverted back to raw units inside the simulator, so
        the evaluation contract is unchanged.
    aux_transform_scale : float
        Scale ``s`` of the transform's linear-to-log knee. For a thresholded

    slice_num : int
        Number of physics-attention slice tokens ``M`` the mesh is projected

    mlp_ratio : int

        Dropout probability applied within each Transolver block.
    node_type_size : int

    noise_std : float

        Active only at ``frames_per_call == 1``: injected single-step noise is

    velocity_history : bool
        Append the window's ``input_frames - 1`` finite-difference velocities

        accumulated position offset.
    frames_per_call : int
        Prediction-scheme axis (ADR-0050/0051): number of frames the decoder
        emits per forward call. ``1`` (default) is today's autoregressive
        next-step scheme — byte-identical to the pre-0051 recipe — and is also
        the legacy-checkpoint fallback (a ``config.json`` written before this
        field reconstructs as ``frames_per_call=1``, so old Transolver
        checkpoints load unchanged). ``0`` is the one-shot sentinel: it
        resolves at train time to ``T_working - input_frames`` (the scored
        horizon of the loaded, ``train_frames``-truncated trajectories) and the
        *resolved* integer is written back into ``config.json`` so evaluation
        rebuilds the identical decoder head without re-resolving. ``1 < k < T``
        is temporal bundling (MP-PDE). The decoder head width is
        ``frames_per_call * (dim + 1)``, so a checkpoint's ``k`` is fixed at
        train time; k>1 is a Transolver-only scheme (the neural-CFL audit in
        ADR-0051 keeps message-passing backbones at k=1).
    hybrid_mp : bool
        Enable the Design A hybrid local message-passing branch: a middle-block
        MGN-style residual (edge MLP → mean-normalized aggregate → node MLP) on
        a dynamic k-capped radius graph, parallel to Physics-Attention. ``False``
        (default) is byte-identical vanilla Transolver — no MP submodules are
        built and the graph argument stays ``None``, so existing checkpoints and
        tests load unchanged. Motivated by the notch off-grid probe gap
        (operators lose the one-step/representation battle ~2.4x to MGN's
        translation-invariant local pathway; the probe-diagnostic ADR). Requires
        ``hybrid_radius > 0``.
    hybrid_radius : float
        Radius (working-frame units) of the MP branch's dynamic graph. Only used
        when ``hybrid_mp``; must be positive then. ``0.0`` (default) is the
        inert value for the vanilla path.
    hybrid_max_neighbors : int
        Per-node incoming-edge cap of the radius graph (bounds ``E <= P*k`` so a
        contact-dense frame cannot blow up the edge activations, unlike MGN's
        uncapped world edges). Only used when ``hybrid_mp``.
    hybrid_blocks : int
        Number of MIDDLE blocks that carry the MP branch (never block 0 or the
        decoder block). Default ``1`` (the minimal intervention: one middle
        block). Only used when ``hybrid_mp``.
